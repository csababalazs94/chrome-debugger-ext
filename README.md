# Chrome Debugger Extension

## Description

This chrome extension will start the javascript debugger after a 3s delay.
This enables you to 'freeze' the browser in a state which you are usually not able, if you are using the console, as some js functions might trigger when you click away to the console window.

## Installation

Open your Chrome -> Settings -> Extensions -> Enable Developer mode.
Load Unpacked option should be visible now.
Click on it and select the folder.
